/**
 * Provides all of the protocol logic for both client and server to undertake
 * the KeepAlive protocol. In the KeepAlive protocol, the client sends a
 * KeepAlive request to the server every {@link #keepAliveInterval} seconds using
 * {@link pb.utils.Utils#setTimeout(pb.protocols.ICallback, long)}. The server must
 * send a KeepAlive response to the client upon receiving the request. If the
 * client does not receive the response within {@link #keepAliveTimeout} seconds
 * it will assume the server is dead
 * and signal its manager using
 * {@link pb.managers.Manager#endpointTimedOut(Endpoint,Protocol)}. If the server does
 * not receive a KeepAlive request at least every {@link #keepAliveTimeout} seconds (again using
 * {@link pb.utils.Utils#setTimeout(pb.protocols.ICallback, long)}), it will assume
 * the client is dead and signal its manager. Upon initialisation, the client
 * should send the KeepAlive request immediately, whereas the server will wait
 * up to {@link #keepAliveTimeout} seconds before it assumes the client is dead. The protocol stops
 * when a timeout occurs.
